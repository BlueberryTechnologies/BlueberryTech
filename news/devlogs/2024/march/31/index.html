              We have decided to condense the site down to what is really
              important. Personally, I sometimes enjoy the look and feel of a
              nice website with fancy JavaScript and CSS but at the end of the
              day what is important is the content that is being displayed. From
              now on, all of the content you will see from us is what is
              important, no bullshit, no filters, no nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
              We as a company are going to try and focus on what is really
              important, learning and improving on our skills. We will continue
              to learn new ways to approach everything and make sure we are
              striving to be the best. If that means sacrificing a 'good
              looking' website then thats fine with me.
