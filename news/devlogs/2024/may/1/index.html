            <br />
            <p>
              Recently we have launched a Blueberry Technologies Minecraft
              server. We figured this would be a good way of practising server
              management as well as have some fun with it. We are using
              <a href="https://minecraftservercontrol.github.io/docs/mscs"
                >MSCS</a
              >
              to manage the server and we use it for ease of access as well
              because we might be adding more worlds in the future.
            </p>
            <h3>The Good</h3>
            <p>
              I found that the plugins are a make or break scenario for the
              server and it really improves on the player experience depending
              on which route you take with them. Personally, I found that for
              the survival side of things having a Vanilla+ world with basic
              warp and tpa commands is really all that a server needs. We
              achieve this through a plugin called EssentialsX which adds those
              basic commands that most everyone is accustomed to.
            </p>
            <h3>The Bad(?)</h3>
            <p>
              To find a perfect solution for everyone is near impossible and
              some people will prefer things rather than others but for the most
              part it has been alright. There have been some issues with
              updating the server and plugin support (mostly going from 1.20.4
              => 1.20.5/6 because of the recent changes to Minecraft also the
              jump to Java 21) but nevertheless it has been a really nice
              experience running our very own server from our own hardware
              instead of outsourcing that from a host provider or something.
