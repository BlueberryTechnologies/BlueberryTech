            <p>
              Happy new year everyone!! It's been a while since our last update
              but we've been hard at work with pushing updates for everyone and
              making sure everyone has a good experience with our services!
            </p>
            <h3>Recent Changes</h3>
            <p>
              We have been updating and maintaining the Minecraft Server
              <a href="https://play.blueberry.dev">play.blueberry.dev</a>, and
              as of writing this the server is playable on 1.21.3=>1.21.4
            </p>
            <p>
              We've ran into some player issues when playing on newer versions
              but we utilize <a href="https://viaversion.com/">ViaVersion</a> to
              achieve the ability for players to play on a separate client
              version than the server.
            </p>
            <p>
              For those of you who don't know, we host everything in house from
              the webpage you're reading this on, to the Minecraft Server. It
              was a nice challenge to get everything to work together and kind
              of a pain... A more in-depth explanation is that we use Ubuntu
              Server 24.04.1 and we use a combination of
              <a href="https://minecraftservercontrol.github.io/docs/mscs"
                >MSCS</a
              >
              to have multiple worlds managed all together. We have all of our
              worlds setup with <a href="https://papermc.io/">Paper</a> and then
              we have a Minecraft Proxy managing all of the worlds called
              <a href="https://papermc.io/software/waterfall">Waterfall</a>.
              Please note that Waterfall has reached EOL, but we will try to
              support it as long as we can mostly because migrating everything
              will result in a loss of some plugins that we use. We have
              multiple worlds that the player can select from such as:
              <b>Survival, Creative, Hardcore</b> and optional legacy servers.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have also added cross platform play with Java & Bedrock
              editions, so no matter where you are or how you play you can enjoy
              our server!
            </p>

            <ul style="list-style-type: none">
              <b>Java</b>
              <li>play.blueberry.dev</li>
              <p></p>
              <b>Bedrock</b>
              <li>mc.blueberry.dev</li>
              <p></p>
              The port used for bedrock edition is the default, but if not
              specified it is 19132.
            </ul>
            <p>
              We are also releasing a little blurb on how to get started with
              Minecraft Modding! If you are interested in getting some mods
              installed and how everything works, please check out the new guide
              we are releasing here!
