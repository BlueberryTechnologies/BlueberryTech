            <p>
              Hello everyone! Here is a little mid-week update for a couple of
              things.
            </p>
            <h3>Recent Changes</h3>
            <hr />
            <h4>https://blueberry.dev</h4>
            <p>
              I have been changing little things here and there with the website
              that you may notice. Things like adjusting the footer and adding
              hyperlinks here and there. I have also added a new project which
              is our Minecraft Modpack <b>Client Side Essentials</b>. For now it
              is under review but you should be able to access with a link and
              when it is approved you can use a third-party launcher such as
              <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/">Prism Launcher</a> to
              download directly. I will also be rolling out version scheming for
              the website soon as well as more features such as:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>More site images</li>
              <li>Staff Pages (So far I'm the only one with a page)</li>
              <li>Better Projects page</li>
              <li>
                Refreshed
                <a href="https://play.blueberry.dev">play.blueberry.dev</a> site
              </li>
              <li>Possibly a social section?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>You will hopefully see these upcoming changes soon.</p>

              I believe I have fixed a bug where the generation for the password
              was not working on Windows machines, this resulted in the password
              being the same string of characters.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Python we are using the <code>time</code> module and there are
              differences between using the functions on Unix based systems (aka
              MacOS and Linux) and it was causing generation errors. You can
              find more information about why
              <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.clock"
                >here</a
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also included a built Executable for Windows platforms and will
              be releasing a Mac .pkg soon.
            </p>
            <p>
              The latest version is v1.3 as of writing this and you can download
              it
              <a
                href="https://github.com/BlueberryTechnologies/Mango/releases/tag/v1.3"
                >here</a
              >.

            <p>
              We have been toying with the opportunity to revive this project in
              the coming weeks. We are looking at new features and a new UI as
              well as a possible name change for the project.
            </p>

            <p>
              I have come upon a decent amount of free time lately and I will be
              trying to update everything and also start some new projects and
              if you would like to stay more updated please check out our
