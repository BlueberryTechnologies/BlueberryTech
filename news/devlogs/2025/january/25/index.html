            <p>Hey everyone, a bit of an update.</p>
            <h3>Recent Changes</h3>
            <hr />
            <h4>https://blueberry.dev</h4>
            <p>
              Not much site updates, I'm working on getting some sort of backend
              up for the members but until then I probably won't have much
            </p>
            <ol>
              Changed the name of BBTBE to Kiwi
            </ol>
            <p>You will hopefully see these upcoming changes soon.</p>
            <hr />
            <h4>Kiwi</h4>
            <p>
              Changed some things, as well as the name. BBTBE -> Kiwi. Released
              v1.1.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can download it
              <a href="https://github.com/BlueberryTechnologies/Kiwi">here</a>.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h4>Bianry</h4>
            <p>
              We are revamping the Mango password generator and we have created
              a new project called Bianry. The name is pending but we thought it
              was a funny typo for binary.
            </p>
            <p>Current Features:</p>
            <ol>
              Password generation with time seed
            </ol>
            <p>
              We are slowly putting out updates and will have some other things
              coming on Patreon too.
            </p>
            <p>Thank you everyone and until the next time! ~Riley</p>
