              In order to start modding Minecraft, you will have to choose a mod
              loader.
            </p>
            <p>There are various mod loaders to choose from such as:</p>

              Some of these loaders benefit more than others in certain
              scenarios but for the most part the two main loaders have
              historically been
              <b>Fabric</b> and <b>Forge</b>.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h2>What mod loader should I use?</h2>
            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0em">Fabric / Quilt</h3>
            <p>
              Fabric is very lightweight and useful if you are struggling for
              performance. If you have a low-end computer Fabric doesn't use a
              lot of resources which makes it easy to run on some older or less
              equipped devices. There are popular mods such as
              <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium/versions">Sodium</a>
              which improves performance on low-equipped devices. This popular
              mod is only available on the Fabric, NeoForge, and Quilt loaders
              and cannot be used by Forge.
            </p>
            <p>
              Quilt is a fork of Fabric and it is a work in progress attempting
              to make it an easier mod loader for developers to make their mods
              on. Some developers are slowly adopting Quilt but as of writing
              this, Quilt is not mass adopted and we would still recommend using
              Fabric, but we will be keeping a close eye on the project.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are more of a Vanilla+ player or will not have heavy
              modpacks I would recommend Fabric.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0em">NeoForge / Forge</h3>
            <p>
              For various reasons (<a
                href="https://neoforged.net/news/theproject/"
                >explained here)</a
              >
              nearly the entire dev team of Minecraft Forge separated from the
              owner LexManos and the original Forge project due to conflicts and
              established NeoForge. NeoForge is the successor to Minecraft Forge
              and more mod developers are starting to support it as well as
              continuing support for Minecraft Forge.
            </p>
            <p>
              NeoForge and Forge are more meant for bigger mods/modpacks and are
              less constrained when it comes to performance. Expect bigger
              bulkier modpacks to be NeoForge/Forge only but the catch is you
              will need the hardware to support it.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <p>
              Our personal favorite at Blueberry Tech is the Fabric loader
              mostly because of the performance gain and also the widespread mod
              support.

            <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0em">Installation</h2>
            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0em">Installing Java</h3>
            <p>
              Before we go installing mod loaders and mods we need to make sure
              we have the basics covered.
            </p>
            <p>
              Minecraft is a game that was written in the programming language
              <b>Java</b> this means that naturally the game supports Java mods.
              You have to make sure you have Java installed on your machine
              before anything happens.
            </p>
            <p>
              All recent versions of Minecraft come packaged with the correct
              version of Java, but you may find that you need to install Java
              separately.
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0em">Installing the mod loader</h3>
            <p>
              Once you have Java installed and have chosen the mod loader of
              your choice you will have to install that on your computer before
              you begin installing individual mods. For this guide we will be
              installing the
              <b>Fabric</b> mod loader.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Close all instances of Minecraft that are open on your computer.
              </li>
              <li>
                Download and run the loader file, in this case we will be
                downloading the Fabric installer which comes in a
                <b>.jar</b> file. You can download that from
                <a href="https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/">here</a> if you
                haven't already.
              </li>
              <p></p>

              <li>
                Once you run the file, you will pick the version of Minecraft
                you want to install it for then click install at the bottom.
              </li>
              <p></p>

              <p>
                <b> Note</b>&colon; When you run the installer make sure you
                install the client version
              </p>
              <li>
                Now you can launch the Minecraft Launcher and you will notice a
                new profile that says Fabric Loader with the version you
                installed. If this profile is there then you can move onto the
                next step.
              </li>
              <p></p>

              <p>
                <b>Note</b>&colon; In order to add mods to your game you have to
                make sure that the mod you downloaded is compatible with the
                Minecraft version you installed the mod loader for. As an
                example, if you installed the 1.17.1 version of Fabric, but are
                trying to use a mod for 1.20.2 you will run into incompatibility
                issues.
              </p>
              <li>
                Next we will be adding a mod to our game, different operating
                systems have different install locations of the
                <b>.minecraft</b> folder so I will list all of them.
                <p>Windows</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    To easily access this folder you can press
                    <b>WIN + R</b> and the 'run' box will appear, you can enter
                    <b>%appdata%</b> in this box and it will bring you to the
                    AppData folder on your computer. You will then see the
                    .minecraft folder. If not then you will have to enable
                    hidden files and folders. When you're in File Explorer you
                    can navigate to the bar at the top where the 3 dots are and
                    select Options. Click the View tab and toggle 'Show hidden
                    files, folders, and drives' to yes.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>MacOS</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    You can use spotlight to easily find the Minecraft folder.
                    Please press <b>SHIFT + Space</b> to start a spotlight
                    search and paste this path in it to open the folder.
                    ~/Library/Application Support/minecraft
                  </li>
                  <br />
                  <li>
                    If you cannot see the folder because it is hidden you can
                    press <b>Command + Shift + .</b> to enable hidden files and
                    folders.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Linux</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>~/.minecraft</li>
                  <p>or</p>
                  <li>/home/{user}/.minecraft</li>
                  <br />
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>
                Now that we have installed our mod loader correctly and have
                identified our mod folder, why don't we install a mod! For this
                example I will be installing a very popular performance mod for
                Minecraft called Sodium.
              </li>
              <p></p>
              <li>
                Sodium can be installed
                <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium/versions">here</a>,
                they are also available to download from CurseForge. When you
                download the file make sure you make sure you are installing
                based on the correct mod loader and version. I enjoy using
                Modrinth because they make it very easy to filter and identify
                which you are installing for!
              </li>
              <p></p>

              <li>
                In our case we installed a Fabric version to 1.21.4 so we will
                be installing the Fabric 1.21.4 version of Sodium. Once this
                finishes installing please place it in your mod folder directory
                located in step 5.
              </li>
              <p></p>

              <li>
                Once you place it into the mods folder, you can start Minecraft
                and make sure you click play on the Fabric profile and you will
                load in with the Fabric Mod loader and the Sodium mod! You can
                replicate steps 6-8 for any other mod you may find but beware on
                the mod loader and versions. There are also some mods that have
                incompatibility with other mods please read the mod description
                to identify any of these issues.
              </li>
              <p></p>
