              In order to start modding Minecraft, you will have to choose a mod
              loader.
            </p>
            <p>There are various mod loaders to choose from such as:</p>

              Some of these loaders benefit more than others in certain
              scenarios but for the most part the two main loaders have
              historically been
              <b>Fabric</b> and <b>Forge</b>.
            </p>

            <h2>What mod loader should I use?</h2>
            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0em">Fabric / Quilt</h3>
            <p>
              Fabric is very lightweight and useful if you are struggling for
              performance. If you have a low-end computer Fabric doesn't use a
              lot of resources which makes it easy to run on some older or less
              equipped devices. There are popular mods such as
              <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium/versions">Sodium</a>
              which improves performance on low-equipped devices. This popular
              mod is only available on the Fabric loader and cannot be used by
              NeoForge or Forge.
            </p>
            <p>
              Quilt is a fork of Fabric and it is a work in progress attempting
              to make it an easier mod loader for developers to make their mods
              on. Some developers are slowly adopting Quilt but as of writing
              this, Quilt is not mass adopted and we would still recommend using
              Fabric, but we will be keeping a close eye on the project.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are more of a Vanilla+ player or will not have heavy
              modpacks I would recommend Fabric.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0em">NeoForge / Forge</h3>
            <p>
              For various reasons (<a
                href="https://neoforged.net/news/theproject/"
                >explained here)</a
              >
              nearly the entire dev team of Minecraft Forge separated from the
              owner LexManos and the original Forge project due to conflicts and
              established NeoForge. NeoForge is the successor to Minecraft Forge
              and more mod developers are starting to support it as well as
              continuing support for Minecraft Forge.
            </p>
            <p>
              NeoForge and Forge are more meant for bigger mods/modpacks and are
              less constrained when it comes to performance. Expect bigger
              bulkier modpacks to be NeoForge/Forge only but the catch is you
              will need the hardware to support it.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <p>
              Our personal favorite at Blueberry Tech is the Fabric loader
              mostly because of the performance gain and also the widespread mod
              support.

            <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0em">Installation</h2>
            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0em">Installing Java</h3>
            <p>
              Before we go installing mod loaders and mods we need to make sure
              we have the basics covered.
            </p>
            <p>
              Minecraft is a game that was written in the programming language
              <b>Java</b> this means that naturally the game supports Java mods.
              You have to make sure you have Java installed on your machine
              before anything happens.
            </p>
            <p>
              All recent versions of Minecraft come packaged with the correct
              version of Java, but you may find that you need to install Java
              separately.
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0em">Installing the mod loader</h3>
            <p>
              Once you have Java installed and have chosen the mod loader of
              your choice you will have to install that on your computer before
              you begin installing individual mods. For this guide we will be
              installing the
              <b>Fabric</b> mod loader.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Close all instances of Minecraft that are open on your computer.
              </li>
              <li>
                Download the loader file, in this case we will be downloading
                the Fabric installer which comes in a <b>.jar</b> file.
              </li>
              <li>
                When you run the installer make sure you install the client
                version
              </li>
